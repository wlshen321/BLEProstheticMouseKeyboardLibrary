# Overview
This project combines an "Air Mouse" with wireless keyboard. It uses the MPU6050 for orientation measurements to control mouse movement, and the ESP32 for general processing + Bluetooth.

Libraries used include the MPU6050 light library by [rfetick](https://www.github.com/rfetick), ESP32-BLE-Combo library by [ServAlex](https://www.github.com/ServAlex) forked from [blackketter](https://www.github.com/blackketter) and [T-vK](https://www.github.com/T-vK)'s BLE repository.

This is part of a larger project, where a prosthetic arm doubles as a remote mouse/keyboard based on (intended) hand gesture. More information coming soon.
